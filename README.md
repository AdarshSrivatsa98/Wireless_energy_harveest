# Wireless power harvesting in Body Area Network for Healthcare

Energy harvesting (EH) technologies, which take energy from ambient sources such as mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic (EM) sources, are used to power autonomous wireless systems.
Wireless energy harvesting (WEH) is to harvest surrounding EM energy to supply continuous power to the selfsustainable standalone devices, which provides a solution to replace the battery or save maintenance cost.

We demonstrate a prototype of a wirelessly powered battery-free BAN sensor for mobile healthcare, consisting of the electrically small triple-band rectenna, DC energy management and storage module, microcontroller, and sensing and communication module.
